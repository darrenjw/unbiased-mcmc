# Discussion

Materials relating directly to my discussion contribution to the read paper, possibly including simple examples. More substantial examples will be developed in the [examples](../examples/) directory.

The [Makefile](Makefile) should provide clues for how to build.


## Some initial thoughts and ideas

* Very brief recap of essential idea
* Discussion of application to parallelisation
    * Essential idea
	* Issue with parallel chains
	* Amdhal's law for parallel chains MCMC
	* How this helps a little but doesn't really solve the fundamental problem
* Implementation issues and how FP helps?
* Investigate initialisation? eg. from same point? Chris S.?
* Example: Gibbs sampler for AR(1)
* Example: Gibbs sampler for GMRF - animation of coupling (Scala code)

### For another day:

* Example: Variable selection?
* Example: Simple parallel tempering example - with animations? Mention relation to Bouchard-Cote stuff?
* Example: Implementation for a general purpose MH PPL?!
