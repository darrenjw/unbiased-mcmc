# Discussion

Materials relating directly to my discussion contribution to the read paper. But see the [examples](../examples/) directory for code. The discussion slides should just `make` on an appropriately configured system. The [Makefile](Makefile) should provide further clues.

For convenience, a pre-built version of the [PDF slides](djw-slides-PREBUILT.pdf) is included.
