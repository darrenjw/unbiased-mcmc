# Discussion

Materials relating directly to my discussion contribution to the read paper, possibly including simple examples. More substantial examples will be developed in the [examples](../examples/) directory.


## Some initial thoughts and ideas

* Very brief recap of essential idea
* Discussion of application to parallelisation
    * Essential idea
	* Issue with parallel chains
	* Amdhal's law for parallel chains MCMC
	* How this helps a little but doesn't really solve problem
* Implementation issues and how FP helps?
* Example: Gibbs sampler for GMRF - animation of coupling (Scala code)
* Example: Simple parallel tempering example - with animations? Mention relation to Bouchard-Cote stuff?
* Example: Implementation for a general purpose MH PPL?!
