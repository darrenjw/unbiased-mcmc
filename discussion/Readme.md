# Discussion

Materials relating directly to my discussion contribution to the read paper. But see the [examples](../examples/) directory for code. The discussion slides should just `make` on an appropriately configured system. The [Makefile](Makefile) should provide further clues.

For convenience, a pre-built version of the [PDF slides](djw-slides-PREBUILT.pdf) is included, though the movies probably won't play without careful setup.

I now also have a pre-build version of my [written discussion](djw-disc-PREBUILT.pdf). Sadly I had to ditch the GMRF example from the written discussion, due to lack of space. But I did flesh out the AR(1) example a bit more.
