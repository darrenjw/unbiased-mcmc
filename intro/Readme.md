# Introduction to unbiased MCMC with couplings

This directory contains a talk delivered as an internal seminar at Newcastle University during October 2019. It is a tutorial introduction to the ideas presented in the paper "Unbiased MCMC with couplings". It is written as an executable R-Markdown document which compiles to both a beamer slide presentation and a regular PDF document. Typing `make view` on an appropriately configured machine should build and view the beamer presentation. But you will need `make`, R, the `rmarkdown` R package, `pandoc`, etc., in order for this to work.
